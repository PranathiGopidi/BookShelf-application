    <br/>
    Here I've developed a Bookshelf application where the user can add/delete/read/update the books.<br/>
    HTML, CSS are used for creating webpage.Bootstrap is used to enhance the view of buttons and the webpage.
    <br/>Angular JS is used for implementing the functionality of adding/deleting/ editing the books.
